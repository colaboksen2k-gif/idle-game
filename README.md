Browser idle game with prestige, combat, mining, and milestones.

## Pushing to GitHub

This repo is already initialized with an initial commit. To add a remote and push:

1. Create an **empty** repo at [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) (e.g. name: `idle-game`). Do not add a README, .gitignore, or license.
2. In this folder, run (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/idle-game.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Git identity (optional)

If you haven’t set Git identity globally, run once (use your real email and the name you want on commits):

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Replace `you@example.com` and `Your Name` with your actual email and name. Future commits will then use that identity.
