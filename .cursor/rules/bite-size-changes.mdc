# Bite-Size Changes

When the user asks for many changes at once, do NOT implement everything in one go.

## How to handle large requests

1. **Identify** all the distinct changes requested
2. **List** them back to the user as a numbered plan
3. **Ask** which to tackle first, OR proceed with only the first/smallest change
4. **Complete** one change, confirm it works, then move to the next
5. **Never** bundle more than 2-3 related edits in a single response

## Why

- Reduces token usage per response
- Easier to review and verify each change
- Simpler to roll back if something goes wrong
- Keeps context window focused

## Example

User asks: "Add a new upgrade system, fix the save bug, and redesign the UI"

- Bad: Implement all three at once in one giant response
- Good: "I see 3 tasks. Let's start with the save bug fix first - it's the smallest. Want me to proceed?"
