# Explain Why, Not What

Comments should explain reasoning, trade-offs, or non-obvious intent. Never narrate code that already reads clearly.

## Bad comments (never write these)

```js
// increment counter
count++;

// return the result
return total;

// loop through items
for (const item of items) {
```

## Good comments (explain the why)

```js
// Offline earnings cap at 8 hours to prevent absurd catch-up gains
const maxOfflineSeconds = 8 * 60 * 60;

// Prestige multiplier applied before other bonuses to match the intended stacking order
return base * prestigeMultiplier * upgradeBonus;
```

## Rule

If a comment doesn't add information beyond what the code itself says, delete it.
