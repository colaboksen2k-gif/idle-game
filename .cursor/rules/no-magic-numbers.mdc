# No Magic Numbers

Bare numeric literals in logic code are forbidden. Every constant must be assigned to a named variable or config key.

## Bad

```js
setTimeout(tick, 1000);
if (count > 99) resetCombo();
reward *= 1.15;
```

## Good

```js
const TICK_INTERVAL_MS = 1000;
const MAX_COMBO_COUNT = 99;
const PRESTIGE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER = 1.15;

setTimeout(tick, TICK_INTERVAL_MS);
if (count > MAX_COMBO_COUNT) resetCombo();
reward *= PRESTIGE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER;
```

## Exceptions

- `0` and `1` used as index anchors or neutral identity values are fine
- Loop indices (`i = 0`) are fine
