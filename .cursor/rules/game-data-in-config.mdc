# Game Data in Config

All balancing numbers — costs, rates, multipliers, durations, caps — must be defined in a dedicated data or config file, not scattered inline throughout logic code.

## Bad

```js
// Hardcoded inside logic
if (player.gold >= 150) {
  player.gold -= 150;
  player.clickPower += 2;
}
```

## Good

```js
// In config/upgrades.js
export const UPGRADES = {
  betterClick: { cost: 150, clickPowerBonus: 2 }
};

// In logic
if (player.gold >= UPGRADES.betterClick.cost) {
  player.gold -= UPGRADES.betterClick.cost;
  player.clickPower += UPGRADES.betterClick.clickPowerBonus;
}
```

## Why

- Balancing changes require touching only one file
- Numbers are self-documenting by their key name
- Easier to export/import for save migration
