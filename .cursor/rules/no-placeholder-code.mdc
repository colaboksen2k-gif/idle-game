# No Placeholder Code

Every piece of code delivered must be fully functional. Never use stubs, skeletons, or deferred implementations.

## Forbidden patterns

- `// TODO: implement this`
- `...` as a function body
- `pass` / `throw new Error("Not implemented")`
- Empty catch blocks left as placeholders
- Functions that return `null` or `undefined` as a stub

## Rule

If a full implementation isn't possible in one step, say so explicitly and implement what IS possible — never silently ship broken code.
